This README would normally document whatever steps are necessary to get the application up and running.

Things you may want to cover:

Create a rails application rails new appartment-gem

Configure database in database.yml file also need to to install gem 'pg'

Database creation

Integrate the gem 'device' for user model

Create a account model and give the reference of users model(account is the current tenant)

Create a project model via a scaffold rails generate scaffold project

Then new to install gem 'acts_as_tenant' and also need to configure it. Below I add the reference link:

https://www.mintbit.com/blog/multitenant-rails-application-using-acts-as-tenant-and-devise

Note: Apartment gem is not working in Rails 6 and Rails 7 projects to implement multitenancy at the db level. Rails natively supports connection switching that can be used to implement this. See https://guides.rubyonrails.org/active_record_multiple_databases.html. If you want table level tenancy, then gem 'acts_as_tenant' works for this.
